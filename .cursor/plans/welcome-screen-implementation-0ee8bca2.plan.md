### 2. **Login Screen** (Frame 10:12)

- Back button navigation
- Title: "Welcome back! Glad to see you, Again!"
- Email input field
- Password input field
- "Forgot Password?" link (right-aligned)

- Auto-focus and auto-advance between OTP fields

### 5. **Password Changed Screen** (Frame 10:24)

- Success icon/illustration
- Title: "Password Changed!"
- Success message
- Back to Login button

## Design Specifications

### Colors & Typography

- Use existing design tokens from `tokens.css`
- Background: `var(--color-primary)`
- Text primary: white
- Text secondary: `var(--color-text-secondary)`
- Input fields: `input-figma` class
- Buttons: `btn-figma-primary` class

### Components & Patterns

- Consistent back button styling (circular, dark card background)
- Consistent form input styling (glassmorphism effect)
- Smooth transitions and entrance animations
- Error state handling with red text
- Loading states on buttons
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Update Signup & Login (Pixel-Perfect) ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Review existing `Signup.tsx` and `Login.tsx` components
2. ✅ Update styling to match Figma exactly (spacing, typography, layout)
3. ✅ Enhance form validation with proper error messages
4. ✅ Add entrance animations
5. ✅ Ensure proper navigation flows

### Phase 2: Implement Forgot Password Flow ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Create `ForgotPassword.tsx` component
2. ✅ Implement email input with validation
3. ✅ Add Firebase password reset email functionality
4. ✅ Navigate to OTP Verification on success

### Phase 3: Implement OTP Verification ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Create `OTPVerification.tsx` component
2. ✅ Implement 4-digit OTP input with auto-focus/advance
3. ✅ Add countdown timer for resend functionality
4. ✅ Handle OTP verification logic
5. ✅ Navigate to Password Changed on success

### Phase 4: Implement Password Changed Success ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Create `PasswordChanged.tsx` component
2. ✅ Add success icon/animation
3. ✅ Implement "Back to Login" navigation
4. ✅ Add entrance animation

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Test complete registration flow end-to-end
2. ✅ Test complete login flow
3. ✅ Test password reset flow
4. ✅ Verify all navigation paths
5. ✅ Test form validations and error states
6. ✅ Verify responsive behavior
7. ✅ Test animations and transitions

## Technical Considerations

- Firebase Authentication methods needed:
- `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` (Signup)
- `signInWithEmailAndPassword` (Login)
- `sendPasswordResetEmail` (Forgot Password)
- OTP verification (may need custom implementation or Firebase phone auth)

- Form validation:
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements
- Password match validation
- OTP format validation

- State management:
- Form input states
- Loading states
- Error states
- Timer state for OTP resend

- Routes to add/update in `App.tsx`: ✅ COMPLETED
- `/signup` (existing, update) ✅
- `/login` (existing, update) ✅
- `/forgot-password` (new) ✅
- `/otp-verification` (new) ✅
- `/password-changed` (new) ✅

### To-dos

- [x] Extract exact design specifications from Figma Frame 10:47 (colors, typography, spacing, button styles)
- [x] Update design tokens in tokens.css if any missing values are identified
- [x] Implement Welcome component with pixel-perfect Figma match (layout, styling, buttons)
- [x] Add entrance animations and micro-interactions to Welcome screen
- [x] Verify and test navigation flow between Welcome, Login, Signup, and Dashboard
- [x] Test responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
